<h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
    Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk <br>
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk <br>
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around <br>
Since I was born<br>
And now it's alright, it's okay<br>
And you may look the other way <br>
We can try to understand <br>
The New York Times' effect on man <br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother <br>
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive <br>
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin' <br>
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive <br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive <br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive <br>
Well now, I get low and I get high <br>
And if I can't get either, I really try <br>
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes <br>
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose<br>
You know it's alright, it's okay<br>
I'll live to see another day<br>
We can try to understand<br>
The New York Times' effect on man<br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother<br>
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'<br>
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me<br>
Somebody help me, yeah<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah<br>
I'm stayin' alive<br>
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk<br>
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk<br>
Music loud and women warm<br>
I've been kicked around since I was born<br>
And now it's all right, it's okay<br>
And you may look the other way<br>
We can try to understand<br>
The New York Times' effect on man<br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother<br>
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'<br>
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me<br>
Somebody help me, yeah<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah<br>
I'm stayin' alive<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me<br>
Somebody help me, yeah<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah<br>
I'm stayin' alive<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me<br>
Somebody help me, yeah<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah<br>
I'm stayin' alive<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me<br>
Somebody help me, yeah<br>
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah<br>
I'm stayin' alive<br>
